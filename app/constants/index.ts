    first:
      " One of the things I enjoy most in life is going to the gym. It became a true passion for me in 2015, when I began taking my health and fitness seriously. I’m grateful I made that choice, it's been an incredibly rewarding journey ever since.",
    second:
      " In 2020, the pandemic led me down an unexpected path, I began hiking. I wasn't outdoorsy my entire life, and the idea of hiking had never piqued my interest. However, the turning point came when a friend invited me to join for a hike that year and it really flipped a switch. Now, in 2025, I’m on the verge of completing my 50th unique hike around Alberta.",
    third:
      " Growing up, basketball was the only sport I played and followed. But over time, I started branching out and developed an interest in all kinds of sports. In 2020, I stumbled upon Spikeball (also known as Roundnet), and it quickly became my favorite. It’s a simple yet fast-paced 2v2 game played with a small net on the ground—similar to volleyball in its rules. If you’ve never heard of it, I definitely recommend checking it out!",

Ever since I created an IMDB account, I found myself constantly hunting down different titles that interested me. In the past, my watch list was monumental, but having experienced all the movies and shows that ever intrigued me has provided a sense of fulfillment.",
    second:
      "What fuels my deep love for movies and shows? It's rooted in the emotions they evoke. The sentiments expressed through these media forms hold profound significance for me. Christopher Nolan stands out as a director who has touched my soul like no other. His unique film style, coupled with the consistently sensational soundtracks, transforms each viewing into a delightful experience.",
