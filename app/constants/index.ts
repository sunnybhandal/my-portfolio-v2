  p1: "I’m a 26 year old UX Designer & Software Developer currently working in the Robotics industry. I realized my passion for UX Design when working as a Software Developer for a Vancouver based startup. As someone who likes to understand all the processes involved in creating software I would regularly meet with our product designer to understand their thought process when developing new sections on our website that I would eventually have to program. From here, I started designing projects for different ideas I had and this made me fall in love.",
  p2: "My life trajectory eventually sent me to a Robotics startup located in California. With this new company, UX Research became a main responsibility as I worked closely with the product and our customers. I would see how they interact with our interface and I would try to understand any pain points to develop a plan to resolve common user issues. Now I find myself eager to learn about the field of UX Design and I’m looking forward to the many ideas I’ll bring to life.",
  p3: "I’m a simple human that is always ready to give a tv/movie recommendation, enjoys sports, and diving deep into anything that piques my interest. Growing up I played basketball for many years and though I don’t play competitively anymore, I still pursue an active lifestyle.",

    first:
      "In 2020, the pandemic led me down an unexpected path – I began hiking. Surprisingly, I wasn't particularly outdoorsy at the time, and the idea of hiking had never piqued my interest. However, a turning point came when a friend invited me to join them for a hike up Heart Mountain in the Kananaskis/Canmore area. It was a challenging hike, taking around 6.5 hours, and it turned out to be a transformative experience.",
    second:
      "After this hike, I became completely hooked. On the same evening, my friend and I committed to tackling the Canmore Triple Crown. This challenge within the hiking community requires completing the three most popular hikes in Canmore in a single day. Just over a month after my second-ever hike, I, along with two friends, successfully accomplished the Canmore Triple Crown in a demanding 8.5-hour expedition. It was easily the most difficult thing I've ever done, and the mental fortitude gained from this endeavor made it profoundly rewarding. In that year alone, I completed 19 different trails in just four months, solidifying hiking as an integral part of my life.",
    third:
      "The Triple Crown fueled my hunger for seeking out other physically challenging feats. Every year, I now set my sights on a new, challenging goal and work tirelessly to achieve it within the year. Since 2020, I've tested myself by learning to do the splits and even running a full marathon. I have a host of exciting challenges on the horizon, all while keeping an eye on the possibility of tackling another Triple Crown in the future. Hiking has shaped me in ways I could never have imagined, and I eagerly anticipate the adventures yet to come.",
